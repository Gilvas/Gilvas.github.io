 Data collection implementation for Google Analytics with JavaScript

## About
The DP6 technical case was developed for implementing data collection for Google Analytics with JavaScript. The [tagueamento.js](https://github.com/Gilvas/Gilvas.github.io/blob/main/js/tagueamento.js) sets the enviroment with Google Analytics and sends data for every page view and events on click.

## Environment
To set up the environment, I've made use of the [NodeJS package](https://nodejs.org/en/):
- sudo [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) i -g serve

After installation, just run serve in the command prompt while inside the [work directory](https://github.com/Gilvas/Gilvas.github.io). In this way, I could make use of a local server http://localhost:5000.

## Validation
To make it easier to see the results, the project was uploaded in my GitHub page repository. You just need to look for my [Environment section](https://github.com/Gilvas/Gilvas.github.io) and view my [github-pages deployments](https://github.com/Gilvas/Gilvas.github.io/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages).
